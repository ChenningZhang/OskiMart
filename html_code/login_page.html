I had a meeting with my board for my team for the club that I am a part of and it was productive. I feel happy, it's been a while since I've been really really happy. I kinda feel like singing "because I'm Happy". Something that happened today that also made my day was that I had pasta for dinner, it had veggies which was really good! yum! I ate a really good lunch too. I am really happy because I am alive and I am healthy and I had a chance to talk to my mom today, I hadn't talked to her in a while. :).
